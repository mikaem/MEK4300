    "On all html pages in these notes there are some buttons in the top right corner. The last button lets you download the page you are currently surfing as a jupyter notebook or a pdf. The notebook can then be opened, modified and run locally. However, the different pages in these lecture notes are connected, with some links going from one page to another. So you probably want to open all these notebooks in a folder where they all live together. To this end there is the first button, which looks like a rocket. The rockets first link will take you to [Binder](https://mybinder.org), where you will have all notebooks available in te same environment. This means, in particular, \n",
    "that the environment has FEniCS installed for you. If you press the button above you get an \n",
    "environment that opens up the notebook version of whichever file you happen to be surfing (for this file it will be *intro.ipynb*). But if you follow the link on the right, you will instead arrive at the top directory structure of these lecture notes.\n",

    "If you are reading this on the web (if this is an html) then the cells are alive and you may change them and rerun if you please. To this end, again choose the rocket button and press `Live Code`. This will load a Binder environment that makes it possible to run the cell interactively, while still remaining in the html-version of this book, without moving to Binder. Please note that the first time a binder image is requested for a new version of this book it may take some time to build and the *Waiting for kernel...* message seems to be hanging. However, after loading the first time, subsequent runs on this and other pages should be much faster.\n",

    "Finally, note that `dolfin` is a C++ module of [FEniCS](www.fenicsproject.org) that has been wrapped and made callable from Python. In these lecture notes we will make extensive use of FEniCS as a tool for solving the various partial differential equations that arise. FEniCS makes use of the finite element method (FEM), and some knowledge about FEM is an advantage, yet no requirement, when reading these notes."
