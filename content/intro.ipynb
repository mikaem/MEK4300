The notebook can then be opened, modified and run locally. However, the different pages in these lecture notes are connected, with some links going from one page to another. So you probably want to open these notebooks in a folder where all live together. To this end there is the first button, which looks like a rocket. The rockets first link will take you to [Binder](https://mybinder.org), where you will have all notebooks available in an environment that can run all examples in these notes. This means, in particular, \n",

To this end, again choose the rocket button and press `Live Code`. This will load a Binder environment that makes it possible to run the cell interactively, while still remaining in the html-version of this book, without moving to Binder. Please note that the first time a binder image is requested for a new version of this book it may take some time to build and the *Waiting for kernel...* message seems to be hanging. However, after loading the first time, subsequent runs on this and other pages should be much faster.\n",

In these lecture notes we will make extensive use of FEniCS as a tool for solving the various partial differential equations that arise. FEniCS makes use of the finite element method (FEM), and some knowledge about FEM is an advantage, yet no requirement, when reading these notes."
