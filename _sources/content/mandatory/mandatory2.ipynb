    "**1b)** What happens at $\\beta=-0.19884$? At $-0.19884 \\leq \\beta \\leq 0$ there are according to White at least two possible solutions. One solution is shown in Fig. 4-11a in White. Another solution shows negative values for $f^{''}(0)$, thus indicating backflow close to the wall. Using different initial guesses for the solution it should be possible to obtain both solutions. Show these in a plot for $\\beta = -0.1$.\n",
