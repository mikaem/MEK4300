    "1. Verify the analytical solutions (3-47), (3-49) and (3-52) in {cite}`white06`. Experiment with higher order \"CG\" elements (the solution is then higher order continuous piecewise polynomials) and compute the *errornorm*. Report tables of the error vs mesh size (`mesh.hmin()`) and comment on the order of accuracy. See [Analysing the error](../chapter3/poiseuille.ipynb#Analysing-the-error) and [the solution for a triangle](../solutions/poiseuille.ipynb#Solutions-computer-exercises-Poiseuille).\n",

Solve the normalized equations for [plane stagnation flow](../chapter3/similarity.ipynb#mjx-eqn-eq:StagnationNonNorm) and [axissymmetric stagnation flow](../chapter3/similarity.ipynb#mjx-eqn-eq:AxiStagnationNonNorm) using both Picard and Newton iterations. Hint: Define a new variable $H = F'$ and solve a coupled system of equations for $H$ and $F$. Start by creating a mixed function space, with test and trial-functions:\n",

    "3. Assume low Reynolds number and use FEniCS to compute a numerical solution of Stokes flow for a driven cavity. The domain of the cavity is $[0, 1]\\times[0, 1]$ and the dynamic viscosity $\\mu=100$. The domain consists of 4 solid walls, where the top lid ($y=1$ and $ 0 < x < 1$) is moving at speed $\\boldsymbol{u}=(1, 0)$. The remaining 3 walls are not moving. Compute the streamfunction and find the center of the vortex, i.e., the point where the streamfunction goes through a minimum. For the driven cavity the value of the streamfunction can be set to zero on the entire exterior domain.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Note that the boundary condition on $\\psi$ follows from the very [definition of the streamfunction](../chapter3/similarity.ipynb#mjx-eqn-eq:streamfunction2D), where it should be understood that the variable $\\psi$ will only need to be known up to an arbitrary constant. If $\\psi$ is a solution, then $\\psi+C$ gives exactly the same velocity field since the partial derivative of a constant (here $C$) is zero. As such we can put an \"anchor\" on the solution by specifying that $\\psi=0$ at the corner where $x=0, y=0$. It then follows that $\\psi$ will be zero on the entire domain.  Along the left hand border, where $x=0$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$, we have the boundary condition on velocity stating that $u=\\partial \\psi / \\partial y = 0$. Since the gradient of $\\psi$ is 0 along the border it follows that $\\psi=0$ along this border. Similarly, for the top lid $v=-\\partial \\psi / \\partial x=0$, and thus $\\psi$ must be equal to $0$ for the entire top lid. The same procedure applies to the last two borders and consequently $\\psi=0$ for the entire border. Note that the value does not have to be zero, any constant value may be chosen.\n",

Use $\\mathrm{Re}=UL/\\mu = 0.01$ (setting density to unity) as in Fig. 3-37 in {cite}`white06`. Set the velocity of the top (at $y=0.5L$) to constant $\\boldsymbol{u}=(1, 0)$. Use pseudo-traction for the inlet located at $x=0$ and the outlet located at $x=L$. No-slip for the bottom wall.\n",

    "   a) Compute the streamfunction. Note that you cannot use homogeneous Dirichlet on the entire domain for this case. Hint: enforce boundary conditions weakly. Use definition of [the streamfunction](../chapter3/similarity.ipynb#mjx-eqn-eq:streamfunction2D) and `n=FacetNormal(mesh)` to implement the weak boundary form (second term on left of [weak form](../chapter3/stokes.ipynb#mjx-eqn-eq:FormStreamfunction)).\n",

    "   b) Make a contour plot, similar to Fig. 3-27 in {cite}`white06`, of the streamfunction. Hint: Dump result to VTK-format  and plot contours using [paraview](http://www.paraview.org/). To create a VTK-file for the streamfunction solution `Function psi`:\n",
