    "\n",
    "FEniCS solves PDEs by expressing the original problem (the PDEs with boundary and initial conditions) as a variational problem. The core of the recipe for turning a PDE into a variational problem is to multiply the PDE by a function $v$, integrate the resulting equation over the computational domain (typically called $\\Omega$), and perform integration by parts of terms with second-order derivatives. The function $v$ which multiplies the PDE is in the mathematical finite element literature called a test function. The unknown function $u$ to be approximated is referred to as a trial function. The terms test and trial function are used in FEniCS programs too.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will learn how to use the FEniCS software, but the focus will be on the physics of flow. We will use FEniCS to generate numerical solutions that we can easily play with to enhance our understanding of what the mathematical equations represent, but we will not go through the inner details of the finite element method.\n",

For 1D problems like the Couette flow we simply divide the computational domain $\\Omega$ into non-overlapping intervals.\n",
