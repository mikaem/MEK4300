    "The Navier-Stokes equations are nonlinear because of the convective term, $(\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{u}$, and in general not analytically solvable for most problems in fluid mechanics. The equations can be solved analytically when the convective term is zero and for a few other simplified flows. In chapter 3 of White we start by considering the types of flow where convection is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "The convection term is never negligible for turbulent flows, where the flow rapidly changes direction in a seemingly chaotic fashion. We will get back to turbulent flows in Chapter 6. For now we assume the flow is laminar. For a laminar flow the convection term will be zero for a parallel shear flow where the geometry is infinite in at least one direction and the velocity vector is parallel to the walls of the geometry. For example, a pipe flow or a plane channel flow as shown below\n",

The gradient of this velocity component is normal to the wall and as such $\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla u = 0$ and the Navier-Stokes equations reduce to the linear equations\n",

    "which is also valid for the axial component of cylindrical coordinates (see Ch. 3-2.2). There are two types of parallel shear flows: Couette and Poiseuille. Couette flows are driven by moving walls. Friction, i.e., drag or viscous forces are then responsible for \"dragging\" the fluid with a direction aligned with the wall. For Poiseuille flows the driving force is a pressure gradient that can be generated using a pump.\n"
