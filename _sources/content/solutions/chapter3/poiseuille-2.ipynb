    "Wow! What happened here? We seem to approximate the solution exactly, or at least up to machine precision. If you look at the exact solution, you'll see that it's a third order polynomial. But we used piecewise linear elements, so how can the numerical solution be exact? An important observation is that the mesh now is uniform, i.e.,  all elements have the same size. And what we observe is actually something called superconvergence, that only happens for uniform meshes. If we make the mesh non-uniform, then we get what is expected and we need to use third order elements to achive machine precision, because the solution is a third order polynomial. Change the order to 3 and mesh_density to 4 to see the expected behaviour.\n",
