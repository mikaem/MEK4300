    "\n",
    "Poiseuille flows are driven by pumps that forces the fluid to flow by modifying the pressure. Fluids flow naturally from regions of high pressure to regions of low pressure. Typical examples are cylindrical pipe flow and other duct flows. A fully developed plane channel flow is shown above. Fully developed Poiseuille flows exists only far from the entrances and exits of the ducts, where the flow is aligned parallel to the duct walls. If we assume the flow is in the x-direction, as shown in Fig. 3-6 of {cite}`white06`, then the velocity vector is $\\boldsymbol{u}(y,z,t)=(u(y,z,t),0,0)$ and Navier-Stokes equations can be simplified to\n",

The solution to a combined Couette-Poiseuille flow can be found as the sum of a Couette solution $u_c$ using zero pressure gradient and a homogeneous Poiseuille solution $u_p$ using zero velocity on walls.

The superposition is possible simply because the governing equation is linear. The principle is used also for transient flows in both Chapters (3-4) and (3-5).\n",

Unfortunately, the Python `UserExpression` `u_exact` is quite slow to interpolate due to the non-vectorized for-loop. For this reason, a C++ version of the same `Expression` is implemented instead, which speeds up the program with approximately a factor of 45.\n"

This error will depend on the mesh size and the order of the polynomial approximation. The error should disappear in the limit of a highly resolved mesh or for very high order polynomials.

A fluid initially at rest will for example respond to a sudden increase in the pressure gradient (we suddenly start the pump) and the volume flow through the duct will then increase monotonically until steady state is reached. The applied pressure gradient may also vary in time. Another scenario is that a wall is suddenly or continuously set in motion, dragging with it the fluid initially at rest. Common for these flows is that the transient term in the Navier Stokes equations cannot be neglected.\n",
