    "Learning by doing, programming is understanding. On most pages there are som buttons, like in the top right corner of this page. The last button lets you download the page you are currently surfing as a jupyter notebook. It can then be opened, modified and run locally.\n",

    "The Binder link provides you with a virtual environment\n",
    "in the form of a Docker container, and in the container all necessary \n",
    "software components are already installed, in order to run the code examples in these lecture notes. \n",
    "This means, in particular, \n",
    "that the environment has FEniCS installed for you. If you press the button above you get an \n",
    "environment that opens up the notebook version of this file (*intro.ipynb*). Note that it is \n",
    "easy to navigate in binder. So you may change the path in the link followed above, or you may \n",

    "If you are reading this on the web (if this is an html) then the cells are alive and you may change them and rerun if you please. To this end, again choose the rocket button and press `Live Code`. This will load a Binder environment that makes it possible to run the cell interactively, while still remaining in the html-version of this book, without moving to Binder. Please note that the first time a binder image is requested for a new version of this book it may take some time to build and the *Waiting for kernel...* message seems to be hanging. However, after loading the first time, subsequent runs on this and other pages should be much faster.\n",

    "Finally, note that `dolfin` is a C++ module of [FEniCS](www.fenicsproject.org) that has been wrapped and made callable from Python. In these lecture notes we will make extensive use of FEniCS as a tool for solving the various partial differential equations that arise. FEniCS makes use of the finite element method (FEM), and some knowledge about FEM is an advantage, yet no requirement, when reading these notes."
