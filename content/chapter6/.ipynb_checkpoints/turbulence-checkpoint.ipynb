    "## Incompressible turbulent mean flow\n",
    "\n",
    "Turbulent flows are governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. However,\n",
    "\n",
    "- there are no simplifications possible by dimensional analysis or through similarity solutions,\n",
    "- no exact definition is known for turbulence,\n",
    "- turbulent flows are not very well understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turbulent flows are usually *defined* by listing their most characteristic properties. Here is what we know\n",
    "\n",
    "- Turbulence is a *flow* property and not a *fluid* property.\n",
    "- Turbulence is always three-dimensional in space and transient. There is no such thing as two-dimensional turbulence.\n",
    "- Turbulence is irregular, with seemingly random and chaotic motion. However, there is order to the chaos. The flow satisfies the Navier-Stokes equations, so it is apparently deterministic. Still, N-S are extremely sensitive to initial and boundary conditions (the butterfly-effect). The slightest perturbations in initial or boundary conditions leads to a completely different solution. Thus, *turbulence is stochastic even though the Navier-Stokes equations are deterministic*.\n",
    "- Turbulent flows consist to a great deal of vortices and vorticity. Vortex stretching and tilting are 3-dimensional phenomena that characterize turbulent flows and these processes can not happen in 2D. If a vortex tube is stretched it must increase its angular velocity to conserve angular momentum. This can only happen in 3D. In 2D vorticity is (unphysically) a conserved quantity.\n",
    "- The vortices come in a range of scales. The size of the largest vortices (the largest scales) is determined by the geometry of the flow, whereas the size of the smallest vortices (the smallest scales) is determined by viscosity.\n",
    "- The energy cascade. Energy is introduced into the flow on the largest scales and dissipated on the smallest. Dissipation $\\varepsilon$ of kinetic energy is defined as\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\varepsilon = \\mu \\boldsymbol{s} : \\boldsymbol{s}, \\quad {\\mathrm{where\\,\\, strain }}\\quad \\boldsymbol{s} = 0.5\\left( \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u} + \\nabla \\boldsymbol{u}^T \\right)\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The strain increases dramatically towards the center of a vortex tube leading to higher dissipation rates in this region.\n",
    "- Turbulence occur at high Reynolds numbers. The normalized  momentum equation reads\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \\frac{\\partial \\boldsymbol{u}}{\\partial t} + (\\boldsymbol{u} \\cdot \\nabla)\\boldsymbol{u} = -\\nabla p + \\frac{1}{Re} \\nabla ^2 \\boldsymbol{u} + \\boldsymbol{f}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Diffusion is stabilizing as it tends to smear out all gradients. Briefly, perturbations (disturbances) to the flow are amplified by convection and dampened by viscosity. If the Reynolds number is large, then diffusion is small and convection dominates, leading to unstable turbulent flows. If the Reynolds number is small then viscosity dominates and perturbations are killed before they can trigger turbulence."

    "Engineers need to be able to predict the behaviour of turbulent flows. However, in a turbulent flow the velocity $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ and pressure $p(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ should really be considered as random variables. In other words, at any point in space and time we will not be able to predict the exact value of velocity or pressure. We can, however, predict the statistical properties of these random variables. This is usually accomplished using ensemble averages or *Reynolds averaging*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider first a turbulent flow that is statistically steady, i.e., the statistical properties of the flow are independent of time. This happens, e.g., for a plane channel flow or a straight pipe flow where the applied pressure gradient (the driving force) is held constant.\n",
    "As previously stated, in a turbulent flow the velocity vector $\\boldsymbol{u}(\\boldsymbol{x}, t)$ can be considered a random variable. If you stand in the same spot inside the statistically steady turbulent flow and measure one velocity component, then the signal will look a lot like Gaussian noise, as can be seen in {numref}`turbvel`."
